<h3>March 13, 2025 - Help us improve our process of accurately recording dates of death</h3>
<p><strong>Dates of death on tax returns</strong></p>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) noticed that tax preparers occasionally include a deceased person’s date of death on the living spouse’s tax return. This may result in the CRA mistakenly recording the living spouse as deceased.</p>
<p>This error can cause major financial and emotional consequences as it can stop all benefit payments to the living person. The benefits that can significantly impact them include the Canada child benefit (CCB), the Goods and Services Tax Credit / Harmonized sales tax credit (GST/HST), the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS). Additional benefits may also be affected.</p>
<p>Therefore, please ensure the date of death information is included only on the tax return of the deceased individual.</p>
<p><strong>Social insurance numbers (SIN) on legal documents</strong></p>
<p>If you are a representative settling a deceased person’s estate, the deceased’s social insurance number (SIN) must be provided with any request or document sent to the CRA. This will help ensure there are no delays in updating the appropriate records with the date of death information.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

<h3>March 7, 2025 - Phishing Scam</h3>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has become aware of a new phishing scam targeting the tax preparation community, where bad actors are prompting EFILERs to log into a fake <strong>EFILE Sign in</strong> page to “activate” their account. <strong>Note that the CRA will never send you a link asking you to provide financial or personal information, including your EFILE number and password.</strong></p>
<p>Protect yourself from spoofing by never clicking links received via text message or email. When visiting a website, always verify the URL and domain to make sure you are on the official website. Only log into your accounts from <strong>trusted sources</strong>.</p>
<p>If you believe that your EFILE ID and password have been compromised as result of this or other scams, contact the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/efile-electronic-filers/efile-helpdesk-support-t1-returns.html">EFILE Helpdesk</a> immediately. Please note that failure to notify the CRA of the potential compromise of EFILE credentials will result in suspension of your EFILE privileges.</p>

<h3>March 6, 2025 - Beginning July 15, 2025, you will need to use Represent a Client to obtain access to an Individual’s account.</h3>
<p>This message provides information on an enhancement and a change to the Canada Revenue Agency’s (CRA) authorization service for Individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Improvements to the Authorization Request service in Represent a Client.</strong></p>
<p>As part of the CRA’s ongoing efforts to improve service delivery by making it faster, easier, and more secure for taxpayers and their representatives, the CRA has enhanced the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/confirm-representative.html#authorize-representative-notice-assessment">Alternative process for individuals</a> Authorization Request service in <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">Represent a Client</a> by removing the five-day processing time. With this new enhancement, representatives will now be given <strong>instant </strong>access to their clients’ account.</p>
<p>To gain instant access to an Individual’s account using the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/confirm-representative.html#authorize-representative-notice-assessment">Alternative process for individuals</a>, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the Authorization Request service in <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">Represent a Client</a>; <strong>and</strong></li>
<li>obtain information from an Individual’s notice of assessment that was sent to them at least six months ago.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> To use the Authorization Request service in <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">Represent a Client</a>, the person submitting the authorization request <strong>must be the same person</strong> seeking to be authorized or a person already associated to a GroupID or a business number(BN) registered in Represent a Client. Authorizations cannot be submitted on behalf of other representatives; however, administrators of GroupIDs or BNs registered in Represent a Client can still manage authorization requests for a group, office or organization.</p>
<p><strong>Upcoming changes to EFILE’s Authorize a Representative service for Individuals</strong></p>
<p>Starting <strong>July 15, 2025</strong>, in alignment with the above improvement, the current Authorize a Representative service in EFILE software will no longer be available for Individuals. As a result, you will need to use <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">Represent a Client</a> to obtain access. However, it is important to note that this change will <strong>not </strong>impact authorization requests submitted through EFILE for Business clients.</p>
<p>We all play important roles in protecting information and mitigating risks by staying up-to-date and vigilant on security best practices. This change, coupled with the measures you have in place to validate the identity of your clients, raises the level of confidence that taxpayer information is fully protected. To prepare for the change, the CRA recommends that you work with your clients to ensure the necessary documentation is available for authorizing access through <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">Represent a Client</a>.</p>
<p>Your Individual clients can give you instant access to their account if they:</p>
<ul>
<li>have access to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">My Account</a> to add you as a representative or to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/confirm-representative.html#individual">confirm your authorization request</a>; <strong>OR</strong></li>
<li>give you previously assessed tax information for you to provide when you submit your initial authorization request in <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">Represent a Client</a>. For more information, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/representative-authorization/confirm-representative.html#authorize-representative-notice-assessment">Alternative process for individuals</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you or your client do not have a CRA account, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/register-cra-sign-in-services.html?account=mya">Register for a CRA account</a>. To obtain full and immediate access to your CRA account, you can use the document verification service to verify your identity without waiting for a CRA security code. For more information, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services/help-cra-sign-in-services/verify-identity.html#section1">Document verification service</a>.</p>

<h3>March 5, 2025 - Reminder: Trust reporting for the 2024 tax year</h3>
<p>For the 2024 tax year, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will continue to administer the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/t3-return/new-trust-reporting-requirements-t3-filed-tax-years-ending-december-2023.html?utm_content=2025-03-03_0840&amp;utm_term=T3_Reporting_Lyris">enhanced trust reporting rules</a> as enacted for tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023. Affected trusts are required to file a <em>T3 Income Tax and Information Return</em> (T3 return), including Schedule 15<em> (Beneficial Ownership Information of a Trust)</em>, unless specific conditions are met.</p>
<p><strong>Bare trusts are not required to file for the 2024 tax year</strong><br/>
As announced on October 29, 2024, bare trusts are not required to file a T3 return and Schedule 15 for the 2023 and 2024 tax years, unless the CRA makes a direct request for these filings.

<p><strong>Deadline to file: 90 days after trust tax year-end</strong><br/>
The deadline for trusts to file their T3 return, and Schedule 15 if applicable, is no later than 90 days after the trust's tax year-end. The tax year-end for most trusts is the end of the calendar year. Trusts with a December 31, 2024 tax year-end need to file their T3 return by March 31, 2025. For more information, go to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/trust-administrators/t3-return/when-file-your-t3-return.html?utm_content=2025-03-03_0845&amp;utm_term=T3_Reporting_Lyris">When to file a trust return</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Trusts with a capital disposition</strong><br/>
The Department of Finance has <a href="/en/department-finance/news/2025/01/government-of-canada-announces-deferral-in-implementation-of-change-to-capital-gains-inclusion-rate.html?utm_content=2025-03-03_0846&amp;utm_term=T3_Reporting_Lyris">announced</a> that it will introduce legislation in Parliament in due course, related to the capital gains inclusion rate change with a new effective date of January 1, 2026. As a result, the CRA has reverted to administering the currently enacted capital gains inclusion rate of one-half. This means that all capital gains realized before January 1, 2026 will be subject to the currently enacted inclusion rate of one-half, unless an exemption applies.</p>
<p>With the proposed change to the effective date, the CRA has now reverted the forms posted online to the currently enacted rate.</p>
<p>The CRA will grant relief in respect of late-filing penalties and arrears interest until May 1, 2025, for impacted trust filers to provide additional time for taxpayers reporting capital dispositions to meet their tax filing obligations. This relief applies to both the filing of T3 information returns (slips) and the T3 return.

<p><strong>Clarifying Period 1 and Period 2 reporting for capital gains dispositions</strong><br/>
While the CRA is administering the enacted capital gains inclusion rate of one-half, we are maintaining Period 1 (dispositions that occurred prior to June 25, 2024) and Period 2 (dispositions that occurred on or after June 25, 2024) reporting on the T1 and T3 schedules. Period 1 and Period 2 reporting is being maintained to ensure continued alignment with the tax slips that have already been published and are currently being issued to Canadians and filed with the CRA. As well, the proposed increase to the lifetime capital gains exemption applies starting with capital dispositions in Period 2 of qualified farm or fishing property and qualified small business corporation shares.

<h3>March 4, 2025 - Reminder - Security practices for electronic filers</h3>
<h4><strong>Purpose</strong></h4>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has noticed a growing threat of financial fraud and digital scams. We all play important roles in protecting information and mitigating risks by staying up-to-date and vigilant on security best practices.</p>
<p>This message includes <strong>simple steps</strong> that you can take to confirm the identity of your client, protect your CRA accounts and your network from cyber threats, and ways to stay alert on the latest scams and fraud trends. These tips are not meant to replace any security procedures present in your organization and should only be considered as best practices that may complement your already existing protocols.</p>
<p>In addition to below, adhering to the following <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/efile-electronic-filers/eligibility.html">EFILE responsibilities</a> will help protect you against scams, and mitigate the release of taxpayer information to an unauthorized user or bad actor:</p>
<ol>
<li>An EFILER must deal directly with their client.</li>
<li>An EFILER must validate the identity of their client.</li>
<li>An EFILER respects that access to the EFILE Electronic Filing Service is limited solely for the purpose of the electronic filing of a return of income. Any other use is prohibited, such as but not limited to document retrieval for income verification purposes.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Validate your client’s identity</strong></h4>
<p>Validating your client’s identity, especially for new clients, before any transaction or release of information, whether that interaction is in person, by phone, or online, is one of the many ways to mitigate potential fraud.</p>
<p>This helps prevent unintended consequences, such as the release of information to unauthorized users or funds to malicious groups or individuals. Completing full validations on older clients is also recommended, as threat actors can be patient when planning more complex schemes. Below are a few ways that you can validate the identity of your clients.</p>
<p><strong>In person</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Authentic, valid, and current Government-issued photo identification</li>
<li>Appropriately complex confidentiality questions about information on file or account</li>
<li>Real-time credit file check to compare the information contained in the report with that provided by the client</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Telephone</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Confidentiality questions about information on file or account</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication</li>
<li>Personal Identification Number system for clients</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Online</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Video call, if applicable, to validate authentic, valid, and current Government-issued photo identification</li>
<li>Document validation software</li>
<li>Multi-factor authentication</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Protect your information and CRA accounts</strong></h4>

<h3><span class="nowrap">February 17, 2025</span> - <strong>Business mail is going online</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Get ready for online mail for business</strong></p>
<p>Starting in spring 2025, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will transition to online mail as the default method of delivering most business correspondence, reflecting the CRA’s ongoing commitment to enhancing service delivery. This means your business clients will stop receiving paper mail and will start receiving most of their notices and other correspondence through the CRA’s secure online portal, <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">My Business Account</a>.</p>
<p>This change applies to <strong>all</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>new business number and program account registrations</li>
<li>existing businesses registered for My Business Account</li>
<li>businesses who have a representative that accesses the CRA’s services on their behalf through <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">Represent a Client</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Businesses can prepare for this change by signing in to or registering for My Business Account and ensuring their account includes an up-to-date email address. Adding an email address allows the CRA to send notifications when important changes are made to your clients’ account and to alert you when there is new mail to view in My Business Account. Your clients can have up to three email addresses on file for each program account, and can also add you or other authorized individuals.</p>
<p>If your business clients are not ready to make the switch to online mail, they’ll need to make a request to activate paper mail using form RC681 – Request to Activate Paper Mail for Business to the CRA or through <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">My Business Account</a> starting May 2025.</p>

<h3><span class="nowrap">January 27, 2025</span> - Security practices for electronic filers</h3>
<h4><strong>Purpose</strong></h4>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has noticed a growing threat of financial fraud and digital scams. We all play important roles in protecting information and mitigating risks by staying up-to-date and vigilant on security best practices.</p>
<p>This message includes simple steps that you can take to confirm the identity of your client, protect your CRA accounts and your network from cyber threats, and ways to stay alert on the latest scams and fraud trends. These tips are not meant to replace any security procedures present in your organization and should only be considered as best practices that may complement your already existing protocols.</p>
<p>In addition to below, adhering to the following <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/efile-electronic-filers/eligibility.html">EFILE responsibilities</a> will help protect you against scams, and mitigate the release of taxpayer information to an unauthorized user or bad actor:</p>
<ol>
<li>An EFILER must deal directly with their client.</li>
<li>An EFILER must validate the identity of their client.</li>
<li>An EFILER respects that access to the EFILE Electronic Filing Service is limited solely for the purpose of the electronic filing of a return of income. Any other use is prohibited, such as but not limited to document retrieval for income verification purposes.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Validate your client’s identity</strong></h4>
<p>Validating your client’s identity, especially for new clients, before any transaction or release of information, whether that interaction is in person, by phone, or online, is one of the many ways to mitigate potential fraud.</p>
<p>This helps prevent unintended consequences, such as the release of information to unauthorized users or funds to malicious groups or individuals. Completing full validations on older clients is also recommended, as threat actors can be patient when planning more complex schemes. Below are a few ways that you can validate the identity of your clients.</p>

<h3><span class="nowrap">January 21, 2025</span> - Lifting of the electronic filing exclusion – Payments that are considered Qualifying retroactive lump-sum payments (QRLSP)</h3>
<p>New for the 2025 tax filing season!</p>
<p>The CRA is introducing an enhancement for the 2025 tax filing season that will allow you to file electronic returns for individuals that have received payments that are considered Qualifying retroactive lump-sum payments (QRLSP). (Applicable to tax year 2024 and later years only.)</p>
<p>Effective <span class="nowrap">February 24, 2025</span>, if an individual provides you with a form T1198, Statement of Qualifying Retroactive Lump‑Sum Payment, or a letter from their employer that contains the same information, you can file the return electronically and advise the individual to keep the T1198 or letter for their records in case the CRA asks to see it at a later date.</p>
<p>You will also be able to submit electronic adjustment requests for your clients if all other conditions have been met.</p>
<p>For more information on QRLSP, visit <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-deductions-contributions/special-payments/qualifying-retroactive-lump-payments.html">Qualifying retroactive lump-sum payments - Canada.ca</a></p>

<h3><strong>January 10, 2025 - Update on the status of Capital Gains Tax Changes</strong></h3>
<p>On <span class="nowrap">September 23, 2024</span>, the government tabled a Notice of Ways and Means Motion to introduce a bill entitled An Act to amend the Income Tax Act and the Income Tax Regulations. This Notice of Ways and Means Motion modified the motion tabled on <span class="nowrap">June 10, 2024</span>. For more information about the capital gains tax changes, please visit the <a href="https://fin.canada.ca/drleg-apl/2024/nwmm-amvm-0924-eng.html">Notice of Ways and Means Motion</a>.</p>
<p>Although these proposed changes are subject to parliamentary approval, consistent with standard practice, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is administering the changes to the capital gains inclusion rate effective <span class="nowrap">June 25, 2024</span>, based on the proposals included in the Notice of Ways and Means Motion tabled <span class="nowrap">September 23, 2024</span>. Parliamentary convention dictates that taxation proposals are effective as soon as the government tables a Notice of Ways and Means Motion; this approach provides consistency and fairness in the treatment of all taxpayers.</p>
<p>The CRA will issue the forms to allow taxpayers to file in accordance with the new capital gains rules by <span class="nowrap"><strong>January 31, 2025</strong></span>. Arrears interest and penalty relief, if applicable, will be provided for those corporations and trusts impacted by these changes that have a filing due date on or before <span class="nowrap"><strong>March 3, 2025</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>When Parliament is prorogued, or dissolved, the CRA will generally continue to administer proposed legislation consistent with its established guidelines.</strong></p>
<p>Upon resumption of Parliament, if no bill is passed in the House of Commons, and the government signals its intent to not proceed with the proposed measures, the CRA would cease to administer them. If this scenario described were to materialize, the CRA will be ready to support taxpayers in ensuring any corrective reassessments of implicated returns are processed.</p>

<p>A new service option, “Make an online request”, has been added to the “Accounts and payments” page in My Account. In addition to the self-service real time transfer options already available, this enhancement allows taxpayers and their authorized representatives to submit requests to:</p>
<ul>
<li>transfer available payments or instalment payments within their own account or to another account or revenue line; </li>
<li>refund available payments or instalment payments; </li>
<li>request a payment tracing; and</li>
<li>request a statement of account in the event the online statement of account function is unavailable to them or does not display the period they would like to see. </li>
</ul>
<p>The new TSS online request functionality will reduce the need to call the Individual tax enquiries line, or prepare and mail paper correspondence.</p>

<h3>October 30, 2024 - CVITP – Important information</h3>
<p>The 2025 filing season is fast approaching! If you plan to volunteer at a free tax clinic again this year and wish to transmit returns electronically, you must <strong>renew</strong> your EFILE account online.</p>
<p>The EFILE suitability screening process will only begin once you have completed your volunteer registration <strong>and</strong> submitted your EFILE renewal request. You will receive an email or a letter to advise you of the result of the screening process. <strong>This process is normally completed within 30 business days of the CRA receiving an online registration or renewal application form</strong>.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that some applications may take longer to process due to circumstances that are outside of the CRA’s control, such as but not limited to: an applicant’s failure to file an income tax return, failure to comply with a requirement to pay, collect or remits taxes, and complex applications.</p>
<p>To ensure that your application is processed before the start of the next filing season, we encourage you to submit your <strong>application before <span class="nowrap">December 31</span></strong>. Please submit your renewal as early as possible to avoid unnecessary delays.</p>
<p>If you are a volunteer from Quebec, your application for NetFile Québec will be processed after your EFILE application process has been completed.</p>
