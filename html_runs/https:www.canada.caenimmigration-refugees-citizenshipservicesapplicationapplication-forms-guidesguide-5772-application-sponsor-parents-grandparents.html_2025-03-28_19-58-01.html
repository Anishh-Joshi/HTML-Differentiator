<p>The 2024 instruction guide is for information only. When a new application package is available, we’ll announce it on our Facebook page, our Twitter account and this website.</p>
</header>
</section>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re invited to apply, you must submit the application to sponsor your parents and
    grandparents <strong>online</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2>This is the instruction guide for the 2024 intake.</h2>
<p>For the 2024 intake, we’ll invite <strong>35,700</strong> people from the remaining pool of potential sponsors who
  submitted an Interest to Sponsor form in 2020. This will help IRCC reach its goal of accepting <strong>20,500</strong>
  complete applications.</p>
<p>You can only apply to sponsor your parents and grandparents if your Interest to Sponsor form is randomly selected.
</p>
<p>If we invite you to apply, you’ll have to submit your application by the deadline in your invitation to apply letter.
</p>
<p>You can check if you were invited to apply using our <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/family-sponsorship/sponsor-parents-grandparents/selected.html">invitation
    status tool</a>. If the tool says you were invited, but you didn’t get an email to the account you put on your 2020
  Interest to Sponsor form, make sure you</p>
<ul>
<li>check your spam and junk mail folder</li>
<li>check your physical mail – if we couldn’t email an invitation, we sent it by mail to the address you put on your
    2020 Interest to Sponsor form.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don’t apply unless we invite you to. If you submit an application without being invited, we’ll
    send it back to you.</strong></p>
<p>If you were not invited to apply, but you’d like your parents and grandparents to come to Canada, they may be
  eligible to apply for a <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/parent-grandparent-super-visa/about.html">super
    visa</a>, which could let them</p>
<ul>
<li>stay in Canada for 5 years at a time</li>
<li>apply to extend their stay while in Canada by up to 2 years at a time.</li>

<h3>Application package</h3>
<p>We encourage the sponsor and principal applicant to thoroughly read this entire instruction guide and then complete
  each of the applicable application forms.</p>
<p>For an application to be considered complete, the sponsor and principal applicant <strong>must</strong> fill out the
  forms listed below and <strong>must</strong> submit them all together in</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://prson-srpel.apps.cic.gc.ca/en/login">Permanent Residence Portal</a> (if you’re applying
    by yourself) or</li>
<li>the <a href="https://prson-srpel.apps.cic.gc.ca/en/rep/login">Representative Permanent Residence Portal</a> (if
    you’re using a paid representative)</li>
</ul>
<p>You must do this for each set of parents and grandparents you are sponsoring. Incomplete applications will be
  returned.</p>
<p>This application package includes</p>
<ul>
<li>the instruction guide with helpful information for the sponsor and principal applicant (the person being
    sponsored) and</li>
<li>the forms required for both <a href="#sponsorforms">the sponsor</a> and the <a href="#paforms">principal
      applicant</a> to complete and include in their application.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should keep a copy of your completed forms and required documents for your records.

<h4>Alternate formats</h4>
<p>If you (the applicant), your sponsor or representative can’t apply online through the <a href="https://prson-srpel.apps.cic.gc.ca/en/login">Permanent Residence Portal</a> or the <a href="https://prson-srpel.apps.cic.gc.ca/en/rep/login">Representative Permanent Residence Portal</a> and require
  accommodations, including for a disability, you can request an alternate format. After we review the request,
  we’ll send you the application package in your preferred format (paper, braille or large print).</p>
<p>Send your email request for an alternate format <strong>as soon as possible</strong> to: <a href="mailto:IRCC.2024PGPALTRequest-2024PGPDemandeALT.IRCC@cic.gc.ca ">IRCC.2024PGPALTRequest-2024PGPDemandeALT.IRCC@cic.gc.ca</a>
  and include the following information in your request:</p>
<ul>
<li>the full name of the principal applicant</li>
<li>the full name of the sponsor</li>
<li>the confirmation number from the 2020 Interest to Sponsor form</li>
<li>the Invitation to Apply letter sent in Spring 2024</li>
<li>a statement explaining that you’re asking for an alternate format</li>
<li>the language you prefer (English or French)</li>
<li>the type of alternate format you are requesting (paper copy, braille, or large print)</li>
<li>whether you want us to send the alternate format application by email or regular mail (note: we can only send
    braille by regular mail)
    <ul>
<li>include your email address if you want to receive the alternate format application electronically to print
        yourself (this will avoid potential mailing delays) <strong>or</strong></li>
<li>include your mailing address if you want a hard copy sent to you</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ask for the application by email, we’ll send you links to the application package, which you can then
  print.</p>
<p>Once we get your request for an alternate format, we’ll reply with instructions and tell you where to send your
  application. You must then fill out and sign the forms, and return your application package in an alternate format by
  mail or courier to the mailing address in our instructions.</p>
<p>To show that you were approved to submit an alternate format application, include a copy of the cover letter we sent
  approving you to apply via alternate format with your application.</p>
<p>We must receive your alternate format application package by the <strong>same deadline in your Invitation to Apply
    letter</strong> for the 2024 intake. <strong> There are no exceptions.</strong></p>

<h3 id="co-signer">Can I have a co-signer?</h3>
<p>Your spouse or <a href="/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#common_law_partner">common-law
    partner</a> may be a co-signer on the sponsorship application. Your combined gross income may help you meet the
  income requirements. You and your co-signer must each provide proof of income from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for
  the 3 consecutive tax years immediately preceding the date of the sponsorship application (tax years 2021, 2022 and
  2023 for the 2024 intake).</p>
<p>If you live in Quebec, see if you <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/permanent/sponsor-family-member/calculating-income" rel="external">meet
    the provincial income requirements</a>, as the Quebec ministry in charge of immigration will assess your income.</p>
<p>The co-signer must</p>
<ul>
<li>meet the same eligibility requirements as the sponsor</li>
<li>agree to co-sign the undertaking</li>
<li>agree to be responsible for the basic requirements of the person they want to sponsor and their family members for
    the validity period of the undertaking</li>
</ul>
<p>The co-signer will be equally liable if obligations are not performed.</p>
<p>If your co-signer is your spouse, you must submit your certificate of marriage. If you were married in the province
  of Quebec, only a marriage certificate issued by the <em>Directeur de l’état civil</em> is acceptable.
  Upload your marriage certificate to your online application under “Additional supporting documents.”</p>
<p>If your co-signer is your common-law partner, you must submit the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/imm5409.html" target="_blank">Statutory Declaration of Common-Law
    Union [IMM 5409]</a> <span aria-hidden="true" class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span><span class="wb-inv">(opens in a new tab)</span> by uploading the document to your online application under the section
  “Additional application forms”. This document must be signed by hand by the sponsor, co-signer and the
  administrator of the declaration.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Defaults</h3>
<p><strong>You can’t become a sponsor or a co-signer if any of the situations below apply to you</strong></p>
<h4>A previous sponsorship undertaking</h4>
<p>If family members you sponsored in the past received social assistance while the undertaking was valid, you
  can’t sponsor until</p>
<ul>
<li>you repay the full amount of any social assistance or</li>
<li>you repay the debt to the satisfaction of the government authority that issued the benefit or ordered you to pay.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Provincial authorities’ contact information</h3>
<p>If the person you sponsor (or co-sign) or a member of their family receives financial support under a provincial,
  territorial or municipal assistance program during the validity of the agreement, you will be deemed in default of
  your obligations and responsible to repay that money.</p>
<p>If you need information about how to repay the money owed, contact your provincial office from the list below. The
  services offered by these offices are available during local business hours only.</p>

<h4>An immigration loan</h4>
<p>If you received a transportation, assistance or right of permanent residence fee (previously called the right of
  landing fee) loan and <strong>you are in default of your loan (you have missed payments), you can’t sponsor.</strong>
</p>
<p>For more information, contact the Immigration Loans Program at 1-800-667-7301 (in Canada and the United States only).
</p>
<h4>Support payment obligations</h4>
<p>If you were ordered by a court to make support payments to a spouse or child and haven’t made payments, you
  can’t sponsor until you resolve the family support matter.</p>
<h4>A performance bond</h4>
<p>If you agreed to pay money to guarantee that an immigrant would fulfil their obligations under immigration
  legislation, you can’t sponsor until you pay the full amount of the bond.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Sponsorship bar for violent crime</h3>
<p>The sponsorship bar prevents people who’ve been convicted of certain crimes from sponsoring a family member.
</p>
<p>If you’ve been convicted of a crime that caused bodily harm to any of the relatives listed below, you
  can’t sponsor anyone under the family class.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Partner” includes common-law and conjugal partners.</li>
<li>Relatives not listed here may still fall under this category. If you aren’t sure,  <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc.html">contact us</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Relatives the sponsorship bar can apply to:</h4>
<ul>
<li>your current or ex-spouse/partner and their children</li>

<li>your parent/grandparent, child/grandchild, sibling, niece/nephew, aunt/uncle or cousin
    <ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>the parent/grandparent, child/grandchild, sibling, niece/nephew, aunt/uncle or cousin of your current or

<h3 id="income">Income requirement for sponsors of parents and grandparents</h3>
<p>You (the sponsor) and your co-signer (if applicable) must meet an income requirement for each of the 3 consecutive
  tax years immediately preceding the date of your application, as outlined in the table below. For the 2024 intake,
  we’ll assess sponsors (and co-signers, if applicable) on their income for the tax years 2023, 2022 and 2021. This
  income requirement applies to residents of all provinces and territories except Quebec. If you live in Quebec, the
  <em>Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration</em> (MIFI) will <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/permanent/sponsor-family-member/calculating-income">assess your
    income</a>.</p>
<p>The income requirement for the 2021 tax year continues to be reduced to the minimum necessary income, instead of the
  minimum necessary income plus 30% to help ensure that no one is penalized for a temporary loss of income during the
  COVID-19 pandemic. Sponsors (and co-signers, if applicable) can count regular Employment Insurance benefits in their
  income calculations for the 2021 tax year only, rather than just special Employment Insurance benefits. Sponsors and
  co-signers can also include any Canada Emergency Response Benefits (whether issued under the <em>Employment Issuance
    Act</em> or the <em>Canadian Emergency Response Benefit Act</em>) and other temporary COVID-19 related benefits to
  their total income for 2021 if they are not part of provincial or territorial social assistance programs. For the 2022
  and 2023 tax years, the income requirement will be the minimum necessary income plus 30%.</p>
<p>Signing the statement of consent (question 8 on the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/imm5768.html" target="_blank">Financial Evaluation for Parents and
    Grandparents Sponsorship [IMM 5768]</a> <span aria-hidden="true" class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span><span class="wb-inv">(opens in a new tab)</span> and providing your social insurance number (SIN)
  will allow IRCC to collect your SIN and request your income tax information directly and quickly from the CRA to
  determine whether you meet the income requirements. If you do not provide your consent, you must complete the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/imm5748.html" target="_blank">Income Sources for the Sponsorship of
    Parents and Grandparents form [IMM 5748]</a> <span aria-hidden="true" class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span><span class="wb-inv">(opens in a new tab)</span> and submit a copy of your notice of assessment
  issued to you by the CRA (Option C printout) for each of the 3 tax years immediately preceding the date of your
  application (tax years 2023, 2022 and 2021 for the 2024 intake).</p>
<p>If you do not have copies of your notices of assessment or other documents issued by the CRA (Option C printout) on
  file, you can view (and print) your tax returns as well as other personal tax information using the CRA’s My
  Account online service. To register or login, visit <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">My Account</a>.</p>
<p>If you reside in the province of Quebec, you will not be required to submit an undertaking of assistance for the
  family members you are sponsoring at this time. You will be contacted when your sponsorship application is assessed.
  At that time, if you meet federal sponsorship requirements, you will be notified that you must submit an <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/permanent/sponsor-family-member/sponsoring-father-mother-great-parent/undertaking-application">undertaking
    application</a> to MIFI so that your income can be assessed.</p>
<p>There is no requirement that you or your co-signer (if applicable) have been a permanent resident, Canadian citizen
  or Status Indian for the 3 years immediately preceding your application to sponsor in order to be eligible to sponsor
  your parents and grandparents; however, you must be a Canadian citizen, permanent resident or Status Indian living in
  Canada when you submit the application.</p>

<h3>How to calculate the family size and how IRCC will assess this information</h3>
<p>You and your <a href="http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1461&amp;top=14">co-signer</a> (if
  you have one) will need to demonstrate that you meet the income requirements for the 3 tax years before the date you
  apply. Your family size is counted on a yearly basis. For the 2024 intake, we’ll assess sponsors (and co-signers, if
  applicable) on their income and family size for the tax years 2023, 2022 and 2021.</p>
<p><a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/imm5768.html" target="_blank">Financial Evaluation for Parents and
    Grandparents Sponsorship [IMM 5768]</a> <span aria-hidden="true" class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span><span class="wb-inv">(opens in a new tab)</span> is the form that IRCC uses to assess the total
  number of people you must account for when determining the income that you must have in order to sponsor. IRCC will
  use the calculation that you enter into Box 7 of the IMM 5768 as a starting point when calculating your family size.
  However, this calculation is not determinative, and IRCC will also confirm the calculation in light of the detailed
  family information in your application.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the number you enter into Box 7 only captures your current family size and does not
  necessarily reflect the size of your family during the 3 tax years before your application date, which is relevant for
  the calculation of your income requirements. If your family size changed during or since those 3 years, it could
  affect the amount of income you need for each of the 3 years. IRCC may also calculate a different family size for
  specific years based on the detailed family information you provide in your sponsorship application.</p>
<p>The steps below help you count your current family size. You will need to enter this calculation into Box 7 of the
  IMM 5768.</p>
<p>This calculation may also help you estimate whether you would meet the income requirements. The steps are based on a
  simplified calculation that doesn’t address each person’s unique situation. We can only confirm you meet
  the income requirements when we assess your application.</p>
<p>Follow these 2 steps to calculate the size of your family:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. How many people are in your family (including how many you sponsored or co-signed before)?</strong>
</p>
<p>Include</p>
<ul>
<li>yourself</li>
<li>your <a href="/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#spouse">spouse</a> (even
    if you’re separated, in most cases) or <a href="/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#common_law_partner">common-law
      partner</a>, who could also be your <a href="#co-signer">co-signer</a></li>
<li>your <a href="/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#dependent_child">dependent
      children</a>
<ul>
<li>their dependent children, if they have any</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>your spouse’s or common-law partner’s dependent children, and
    <ul>
<li>their dependent children, if they have any</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then add</p>
<ul>
<li>any other person you and your co-signer (if you have one) sponsored or co-signed in the past, whom you’re
    still <a href="http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1355&amp;top=14">financially
      responsible</a> for (for example, sponsored refugees) and their family members (whether or not they were included
    in the undertaking)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2. How many people do you want to sponsor?</strong></p>
<p>Include</p>
<ul>
<li>the principal applicant (foreign national)</li>
<li>the principal applicant’s spouse (even if separated, in most cases) or common-law partner</li>
<li>the dependent children of the principal applicant and principal applicant’s spouse or common-law partner
    <strong>and</strong>
<ul>
<li>their dependent children, if they have any</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You must include <strong>all the above family members</strong>, even if they <strong>will not</strong> come to Canada
  with your parents or grandparents and even if the family members are permanent residents of Canada or Canadian
  citizens.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Children who meet the definition of a dependent child must be included in the calculation,
    even if the parent does not have custody or does not provide child support.</p>
</div>
<p>Add the total number of people covered in steps 1 and 2. This total number represents the size of your family and how
  many people you will be financially accountable for. You will need to do this for each of the 3 years prior to the
  year you submit an application as your family size may have changed. For the 2024 intake, these are the tax years
  2023, 2022 and 2021. Look at the <a href="#income-table">Income requirement table</a> to estimate if you meet the
  income requirements for each year based on your family size for that year. Note that your calculations will only be an
  estimate.</p>
<p>For more information and examples of counting family size, visit <a href="https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1460&amp;top=14">How do I calculate my family size to
    sponsor my parents and grandparents?</a></p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the case of a principal applicant who is separated from their spouse, the principal
    applicant’s separated spouse is considered a “family member”, as per paragraph <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-1.html">R1(3)(a)</a> of the
    <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations</em>, since they are still legally married until they are
    divorced. However, it should be noted that there could be situations in which subparagraph <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-5.html">R5(b)(ii)</a>, which details
    excluded relationships, applies to a foreign national (i.e. the principal applicant). A separated spouse of a
    foreign national must be counted for the calculation of the minimum necessary
    income <strong>unless</strong> the spouse has lived separate from the foreign national for at least one
    year <strong>and</strong> is the common-law partner of another person. For clarity, either the foreign
    national (i.e. the principal applicant) or their separated spouse may be the common-law partner of another person.
  </p>
</div>
<h3>If your family size changes throughout processing</h3>
<p>If your family size changes while your application is being processed, the income requirements you need to meet may
  also change. Let us know if your family size has changed through the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form.html?v1">Web form</a>.
</p>
<p>In a case where the principal applicant passes away while an application is being processed, we may still process the
  application for permanent residence of their spouse or common-law partner, and any dependent children should they
  still wish to become permanent residents. You will need to inform us using the Web form and include a copy of the
  death certificate, an updated IMM 1344 and an updated IMM 0008.</p>
<p>The <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations</em> provide that a sponsor’s family size and, in turn,
  the minimum necessary income, must be assessed on a year-by-year basis for each of the 3 tax years immediately
  preceding the date of receipt of the sponsorship application, including any increases (for example, birth, marriage,
  new common-law relationships, and so on) or decreases (for example, death, divorce, end of common-law relationships,
  end of an undertaking, and so on) in the family size from year to year.</p>
<h4>Counting increases and decreases to the family size for parent and grandparent applications</h4>
<p>While increases and decreases in family size impact all sponsors and co-signers who must meet an income requirement,
  due to the number of years they must meet an income requirement, these changes are more likely to occur among sponsors
  and co-signers of parents or grandparents.</p>
<p>By assessing family size on a year-by-year basis, the family size may have increased within the 3 years preceding the
  date of the receipt of the sponsorship application. IRCC will include any marriages, common-law relationships and/or
  births for the year in which the increase to the family size occurred. For example, the sponsor got married and had a
  newborn child in 2023 (the couple were not common-law partners before their marriage). The sponsor submits a parent or
  grandparent application in 2024. The income requirements must be met for years 2023, 2022 and 2021. The sponsor’s
  spouse and newborn child must only be counted in the family size for the year 2023. However, if the sponsor’s
  spouse co-signs the application, the spouse must be included in all 3 years (please see “<a href="#co-signers">Co-signers and non-co-signers of parent and grandparent applications</a>” below for further
  details).</p>
<p>By assessing family size on a year-by-year basis, the family size may have decreased within the 3 years preceding the
  date of the receipt of the sponsorship application. IRCC will include any deceased family members, divorced family
  members, former common-law partner(s), former dependent children and/or previous undertakings in the family size for
  any year that the family members were part of the family size. For example, the sponsor’s father, who was married to
  the sponsor’s mother, passed away in 2020. The sponsor submits a parent or grandparent application in 2022 to sponsor
  their mother. The income requirements must be met for years 2021, 2020 and 2019. The sponsor’s father must be counted
  in the family size for years 2020 and 2019.</p>
<h4 id="co-signers">Co-signers and non-co-signers of parent and grandparent applications</h4>
<p>A co-signing spouse or a co-signing common-law partner of the sponsor must be included in the family size for all
  years. This means that IRCC will include the co-signer in all 3 relevant years when calculating family
  size, <strong>regardless of when the sponsor and co-signer married or became common-law partners</strong>.</p>
<p>A non-co-signing spouse or non-co-signing common-law partner of the sponsor must only be included in the family size
  calculation starting the year they married or became common-law partners. For example, a sponsor became a common-law
  partner in 2022. They submit a parent or grandparent application in 2024 with no co-signer. The income requirements
  must be met for years 2023, 2022 and 2021. As there is no co-signer on the application, the sponsor’s common-law
  partner must only be counted in the family size for 2022 and 2023.</p>
<h3 id="income-table">Income requirement for Parent and Grandparent Sponsorship who apply in 2024</h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This table applies to all sponsors who submit an application on or after January 1, 2024 up to
  December 31, 2024. Since many sponsors (and co-signers, if there is one) may have been affected financially by the
  COVID-19 pandemic, we have reduced the income requirement for the 2021 tax year. We’ll apply the reduced income
  requirement when we assess the sponsorship application, and at any point when we have to reassess income from 2021.
  This does not affect the income requirement for the 2022 or 2023 tax years.</p>

<p>To calculate this number, add your answers from steps 1 and 2 above on how to calculate your family size. The
        figures outlined in the table above are based on the most recent figures available from Statistics Canada and
        are applicable to potential sponsors (and co-singers, if applicable) who apply in 2024. The questions provided
        to help you calculate your family size in order to estimate whether you meet the income requirements are
        designed to provide you with an estimate only and cannot serve as confirmation of whether you meet the income
        criteria. They are based on a simplified calculation that does not address the circumstances of all prospective
        sponsors. For example, if your family size has changed during the relevant time period (for example, through the
        birth of a child), then calculating your current family size may not provide you with an accurate estimate of
        the income that you need in order to sponsor your parent(s) or grandparent(s).</p>
<p>When we assess your application, we will calculate your family size and assess whether you meet the necessary
        income requirements in accordance with the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the Immigration and
        Refugee Protection Regulations and based on your specific circumstances. No responsibility is accepted by or on
        behalf of the Government of Canada and its employees and agents for any errors, omissions or misleading
        statements arising out of the simplified steps for estimating the income requirements that are set out in this

<h3>Do I (the sponsor) have to continue to meet the income requirements during the processing of the application?</h3>
<p>If new information indicates that you may no longer meet the income requirements, your income may be reassessed at
  any time during processing. Your income could also be reassessed if more than 12 months have passed between the dates
  since we received your application and when processing of the application begins.</p>
<p>You and your co-signer, if applicable, must meet the income requirements outlined in the <a href="#income">Income for
    Parents and Grandparents Sponsorship</a> from the date on which IRCC receives your sponsorship application until the
  day your family members become permanent residents of Canada.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Withdrawal of co-signer support</h3>
<p>If you change your mind about your support as a co-signer, you must inform the Case Processing Centre (CPC) of your
  decision to withdraw from the undertaking <strong>before the people you’re sponsoring become permanent residents
    of Canada</strong>. You must use this <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form.html?v1">Web form</a>
  and clearly state your name, date of birth and unique client identifier (UCI), if known, in all correspondence.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you inform the CPC <strong>before</strong> the sponsored people become permanent residents of Canada
    <ul>
<li>the CPC will record the withdrawal of your support. You and the sponsor will be informed in writing that your
        withdrawal was received.</li>
<li>We will assess the sponsorship application to see if the sponsor has enough money to support the people they
        are seeking to sponsor without a co-signer.</li>
<li>If the sponsor does not meet the financial requirements on their own, the sponsorship eligibility assessment
        will be failed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you inform the CPC <strong>after</strong> the sponsored people have been granted permanent residence
    <ul>
<li>the commitment you, as a co-signer, and the sponsor signed to support their family members is valid for the
        length of the undertaking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The sponsor will be advised of the final decision on the withdrawal request in all cases.

</div>
<h3>What happens if I (the sponsor) fail to meet the obligations of my undertaking?</h3>
<p>If a family member you sponsored receives financial support from a provincial, territorial or municipal social
  assistance program while the undertaking is still valid, you</p>
<ul>
<li>will be considered to be in default of your obligations,</li>
<li>must repay the government concerned any benefits (social assistance) the person(s) you sponsored received, and
  </li>
<li>will not be allowed to sponsor other members of the family class until you have repaid the amount of these
    payments to the government concerned.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Could my application be refused?</h3>
<p>There are many possible reasons why an application may be refused. Some examples are</p>
<ul>
<li>the person you want to sponsor is not a member of the family class</li>
<li>you may not meet the financial requirements</li>
<li>the person you want to sponsor or their family members may not have provided the required documents, as requested
  </li>
<li>the relationship between you and the person you want to sponsor or their family members is not genuine or has been
    entered into for immigration purposes only</li>
<li>the person you want to sponsor or their family members have a criminal record or serious illness</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Suspension of processing</h3>
<p>If any of the proceedings below apply to you (the sponsor) and you submit a sponsorship application, your application
  will not be processed until a final decision is rendered with respect to that proceeding.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been charged with the commission of an offence that is punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at
    least 10 years.</li>
<li>You are the subject of a report that would render you inadmissible to Canada.</li>
<li>You are the subject of an application to revoke your citizenship.</li>
<li>You are the subject of a certificate signed by the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship and the
    Solicitor General of Canada stating you are inadmissible on grounds of security, human or international rights
    violation, serious criminality or organized criminality.</li>
<li>You are appealing the loss of your permanent resident status.</li>

<h3>Using a representative</h3>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If a paid representative is submitting your application online on your behalf, they must
      sign in to their <a href="https://prson-srpel.apps.cic.gc.ca/en/rep/login">Representative Permanent Residence
        Portal</a> account to do so. You, as the principal applicant, need to electronically sign your application and
      your representative must also provide their declaration before submitting the application.</p>
</div>
<p>If you want to authorize a representative to act on your behalf (paid or unpaid) you must</p>
<ul>
<li>submit a <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/imm5476.html" target="_blank">Use of a Representative

<h3>Who should be included in the sponsorship application?</h3>
<p>The application should include</p>
<ul>
<li>the principal applicant who is being sponsored as a parent or grandparent of the sponsor</li>
<li>the principal applicant’s spouse (even if separated, in most cases) or common-law partner</li>
<li>the principal applicant’s dependent children from current and previous relationships, whether they are
      coming to Canada or not</li>
<li>the dependent children of the principal applicant’s spouse or common-law partner</li>
<li>the dependent children of any dependent children included on the application</li>
</ul>
<p>All the dependent family members, whether accompanying the principal applicant to Canada or not, must be declared on
    the application and be examined. If family members are not examined, it is not possible to sponsor them at a later
    date. This includes children in the custody of a former spouse or common-law partner.</p>
<p>In addition, failure to declare dependent family members on the application and have them examined goes against the
    duty to provide truthful and accurate information, and may cause them to be found inadmissible to Canada.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the case of a principal applicant who is separated from their spouse, the principal
      applicant’s separated spouse is considered a “family member”, as per paragraph <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-1.html" rel="external">R1(3)(a)</a>,
      since they are still legally married until they are divorced. However, it should be noted that there could be
      situations in which subparagraph <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-5.html">R5(b)(ii)</a>, which details
      excluded relationships, applies to a foreign national (i.e. the principal applicant). A separated spouse of a
      foreign national must be counted for the calculation of the MNI <strong>unless</strong> the spouse has
      lived separate from the foreign national for at least one year <strong>and</strong> is the common-law
      partner of another person. For clarity, either the foreign national (i.e. the principal applicant) or their
      separated spouse may be the common-law partner of another person.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt id="family">Family members</dt>
<dd>
<p>Your (the principal applicant’s) family members include your spouse (even if separated, in most cases) or

        dependent children.</p>
</dd>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>Proxy, telephone, fax, Internet and similar forms of marriage where one or both parties were not physically
          present are no longer considered as valid spousal relationships under the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection

</div>
</dd>
<dt>Common-law partner</dt>
<dd>
<p>Refers to a person who is living in a conjugal relationship with another person and has done so continuously for
        a period of at least 1 year. A conjugal relationship exists when there is a significant degree of commitment
        between 2 people.</p>
<p>This can be shown with evidence that the couple share the same home, support each other financially and
        emotionally, have children together, or present themselves in public as a couple.</p>
<p>Common-law partners who have been in a conjugal relationship for at least 1 year, but are unable to live together
        or appear in public together because of legal restrictions in their home country or who have been separated for
        reasons beyond their control (for example, civil war or armed conflict) may still qualify and should be included
        on the application.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Dependent children</dt>
<dd>
<p>Your child or the child of your spouse or common-law partner can be considered a dependent child if that child
        meets the requirements below on the day we receive your complete application:</p>
<ul>
<li>they’re under 22 years old</li>
<li>they don’t have a spouse or common-law partner</li>
</ul>
<p>Children 22 years old or older qualify as dependants only if they meet both of these requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>they have depended on their parents for financial support since before the age of 22</li>
<li>they are unable to financially support themselves because of a mental or physical condition</li>
</ul>
<p>Not sure which type of dependant your child is? <a href="http://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/sponsor/aod-tool.asp">Check if your child qualifies as a
          dependant by answering a few questions</a>.</p>

<h3>Does the principal applicant need to include a dependent child in the sole custody of a former spouse or partner in
    their application?</h3>
<p>The principal applicant must list a dependent child in the sole custody of a former spouse or partner on the
    application for permanent residence since all family members, whether accompanying to Canada or not, must be declared
    and examined. If a child is not declared and examined, that child will not be able to be sponsored as a member of the
    family class in the future, regardless of changes to custody or living circumstances. To preserve the right to sponsor
    that child in the future, the child must be declared on the application and examined.</p>

<h3>Biometric (fingerprints and photo) requirements</h3>
<p>You and your family members may need to appear in person to have fingerprints and a photograph (biometric information) taken at a biometric collection service point.</p>
<p><strong>Canadian citizens</strong> and <strong>existing</strong> permanent residents of Canada are <strong>exempt</strong> from giving biometrics.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>As of December 3, 2019, you need to give biometrics when you apply from <strong>within Canada</strong>. You can go to a <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/where-to-give-biometrics.html">designated Service Canada location</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Find out if you need to give <a href="https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/biometrics.asp">biometrics</a>.</p>
<p>If you have to give biometrics, you can give them after you:</p>
<ul>
<li>pay for and submit your application and biometric fees, and</li>
<li>get a biometric instruction letter (BIL) which will direct you to a list of biometric collection service points you may choose from</li>
</ul>
<p>You must bring the BIL with you to the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/where-to-give-biometrics.html">biometric collection service point</a> to give your biometrics.</p>
<p>We encourage you to give your biometrics as soon as possible after getting the BIL. We’ll start processing your application after we get your biometrics.</p>
<h4>When to give your biometrics</h4>
<p>You will need to pay for and then give your biometrics, even if you gave biometrics in the past to support a visitor visa, study or work permit application, or a different permanent resident application.</p>
<h4>Where to give your biometrics</h4>
<p>You <strong>need to book an appointment</strong> to give your biometrics at one of these official <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/campaigns/biometrics/where-to-give-biometrics.html">biometric collection service points</a>.</p>

<li>Pay the fees</li>
<li>Check your application to avoid common mistakes</li>
<li>Submit the application</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h2 id="gather">Step 1. Gather documents</h2>
<h3>What documents are required?</h3>
<p>Use the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/imm5771.html" target="_blank">Document Checklist [IMM 5771]</a> <span aria-hidden="true" class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span><span class="wb-inv">(opens in a new tab)</span> to ensure you submit all the required documentation listed in the checklist. You must upload this checklist to your online application under the section “Additional application forms.”</p>
<p>Incomplete applications will be returned through the Permanent Residence Portal or the Representative Permanent Residence Portal. For your application to be considered complete you must include</p>
<ul>
<li>all the information asked for on the online forms from you (the sponsor)</li>
<li>the forms completed by the principal applicant, and</li>
<li>all supporting documents we ask for</li>
<li>the fees</li>
</ul>
<p>All documents required for a complete application must be submitted together, at the same time, for each set of parents and grandparents you are sponsoring.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you can’t provide one or more documents required on the document checklist, you must provide a written explanation for each missing document so your application is not delayed in processing or returned to you as incomplete. You must also provide any other evidence or documents you have available to satisfy the requirement. Upload your explanation to your online application under the section “Additional supporting documents” and select the document name “Letter of explanation.”</p>
</div>
<p>It’s helpful to include any proof that you applied to get supporting  documents (for example, a marriage certificate payment receipt). The officer  processing your application will contact you if they need more information.</p>
<h3>Status in Canada document</h3>
<p>You must include a copy of the <strong>same</strong> status in Canada document you submitted with your Interest to Sponsor form in 2020 with your application to sponsor your parents and grandparents. Upload your status in Canada document to your online application under the section “Supporting documents.” Acceptable status in Canada documents include</p>
<ul>
<li>permanent resident card (both sides)</li>
<li>Record of Landing (IMM 1000) (only if you didn’t get a permanent resident card)</li>
<li>Confirmation of Permanent Residence (IMM 5292 or IMM 5688)</li>
<li>Canadian citizenship certificate or card (both sides)</li>
<li>Canadian birth certificate
    <ul>
<li>If you were born in Quebec, we’ll only accept a birth certificate from the <em>Directeur de l’état civil.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Canadian passport (pages showing passport number, date of issue and expiration, photo, name, surname, place and date of birth)</li>
<li>secure certificate of Indian status</li>
</ul>
<p>If you submitted a passport, other than a Canadian passport, with your Interest to Sponsor form in 2020, please submit a copy of the passport you submitted <strong>and</strong> one of the documents listed above to confirm your status in Canada.</p>
<p>If you are a Canadian citizen and you <strong>don’t</strong> have your citizenship certificate or card, you can urgently apply for a</p>
<ul>
<li>citizenship certificate, or</li>
<li>search of citizenship records</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can’t get proof of your Canadian citizenship within the period you have to apply, you can include an explanation letter saying</p>
<ul>
<li>why you don’t have it, and</li>
<li>what steps you’ve taken to get it</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your Invitation to Apply</h3>
<p>You must upload a copy of your Invitation to Apply letter that you received as part of the 2024 intake to your online application under the section “Supporting documents.” Only applications from sponsors who have been invited to apply will have their applications assessed. If you submit an application and you were not invited to apply, we will return your application.</p>

If we can’t match the information on your application with the information on the Interest to Sponsor form, we may not accept your sponsorship application and we’ll return it to you. If your name or mailing address has changed since you submitted the Interest to Sponsor form in 2020, include a letter explaining any changes. Upload your explanation to your online application under the section “Additional supporting documents” and select the document name “Letter of explanation.” If you need to make any changes to your information after you submit your application, you can send a request using our <a href="https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=052&amp;top=3">Web form</a>.</p>

<h3>Be complete and accurate</h3>
<p>Complete all sections on the forms. If a section does not apply to you, type “Not Applicable” or “NA”.</p>
<p>If you need more space for any section, include an additional page containing the appropriate section, complete it and upload it to your application under the section “Additional supporting documents” and select the document name “Other.”</p>
<h4>Uploading additional supporting documents to your online application</h4>
<p>Upload additional supporting documentation to your online application [for example, Curriculum Vitae (CV)/Resume, translations, etc.] under the section “Additional supporting documents” and select the document name in the search menu. If the document name for your document is not available, select “Other.” Upload your documents or other additional information in any of the following formats: JPG, JPEG, PDF, PNG, DOC or DOCX.</p>
<p>Enter names into forms exactly as they appear on the person’s passport. If there are any differences in how a name is displayed on other identification, provide documents to support the difference (for example, a legal proof of name change, if you changed your name) or a letter of explanation (if it’s a discrepancy between legal documents, such as a different name on your birth certificate). Upload your explanation to the online application under the section “Additional supporting documents” and select the document name “Letter of explanation.”</p>

<h3>Police certificates</h3>
<p>You don’t need police certificates when you submit your complete application. <strong>We ask you for police certificates for the person being sponsored and all family members 18 or older (who aren’t already Canadian citizens or permanent residents) later in the application process</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="pay">Step 3. Pay the fees</h2>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>Use the table below to calculate the total amount of fees to be paid (all fees are in Canadian dollars). Processing fees must be included with this application.</p>
<p>You only need to pay fees for people you are sponsoring to come to Canada. You don’t need to pay fees for people who are included on the application but aren’t coming with the people you’re sponsoring.</p>
<p>We recommend you pay the <a href="https://www.ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/fees.asp#rprf">right of permanent residence fee</a> ($575) now to avoid delays. You will have to pay it before you become a permanent resident.</p>

<h2 id="mail">Step 4. Check your application to avoid common mistakes</h2>
<h3>If your parents or grandparents have dependent children</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your application includes a dependent child (under the age of 18) and one parent is not immigrating to Canada, the parent or guardian not coming to Canada must submit a hand signed copy of the <a href="/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/imm5604.html" target="_blank">Declaration from Non-Accompanying Parent/Guardian for Minors Immigrating to Canada [IMM 5604]</a> <span aria-hidden="true" class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span><span class="wb-inv">(opens in a new tab)</span> Upload this form to your online application under the section “Additional application forms.” You must include a piece of photo identification from the parent/guardian who is <strong>not</strong> accompanying the minor to Canada, which displays their signature. If having this form signed by the other parent is impossible (for example, their whereabouts are unknown), you must include an explanation under the section “Additional supporting documents” and select the document name “Letter of explanation.” An officer will review this explanation and advise you of any next steps.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>IMM 5669, IMM 5406, IMM 5562 and if applicable, IMM 5476</h3>
<ul>
<li>The principal applicant must complete these forms for themselves and <strong>each</strong> of their dependants who are 18 years of age or older (whether coming to Canada or not) and who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents. This means that if the principal applicant has 2 dependants who are older than 18 and are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents, they will fill out these digital forms in their online application for themselves and each dependant.</li>
</ul>
<h3>IMM 5476</h3>
<ul>
<li>If using an authorized representative, this form must be provided by both the sponsor and the principal applicant. For sponsorship applications, you must complete and upload separate forms for the sponsor and principal applicant under “Additional application forms” in your online application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>IMM 0008</h3>
<ul>
<li>For sponsorship applications, the principal applicant’s spouse or common-law partner must be included on the IMM 0008 form, whether they’ll immigrate to Canada or not.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marriage certificates</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have a co-signer and they are your spouse, make sure you upload a copy of your valid marriage certificate with your application under “Additional supporting documents.” The document(s) you submit must show that the marriage was legally registered with the government where it took place.
    <ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> A record of solemnization is <strong>not acceptable </strong>for marriages that were legally registered in Canada or the United States of America.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you are only sponsoring one parent or grandparent because the other is deceased, you don’t need to include a marriage certificate. You should include a letter explaining the situation, as well as the deceased parent’s death certificate.</li>
<li>If your parents don’t have a marriage certificate, include a detailed explanation as to why you can’t provide one.</li>
<li>If your parents are divorced, you can include a notarized divorce certificate to prove your parent is not a dependant of your other parent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Passports</h3>
<ul>
<li>Passports for each person being sponsored should include all the pages and be uploaded under “Additional supporting documents” in your online application.</li>
<li>The sponsor’s and co-signer’s passport should
    <ul>
<li>include the pages showing the passport number, issue and expiry dates, photo, name, surname, and place and date of birth</li>
<li>be uploaded under “Supporting documents” in your online application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You don’t need to get translations for the stamps in passports.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Birth certificates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you upload a copy of your birth certificate, and (if you have included dependants in your application) the birth certificates of your family members under “Supporting documents” in your online application.</li>
<li>If you don’t have access to a birth certificate for someone you’re sponsoring, or the one you have doesn’t clearly show your relationship (for example, a name is incorrect), you can give a document that shows the relationship between you and your family member along with a letter of explanation. You should also still include a copy of your birth certificate.</li>
<li>If you are sponsoring the mother/father of your mother/father, you must include a photocopy of your mother/father’s birth certificate, to clearly show the relationship between the two of you (the sponsor and the grandparent).</li>
<li>If your child/parent relationship is through a legal adoption, upload a copy of the Final Adoption Order (and certified translation, if not in English or French) under “Supporting documents” in your online application. The officer processing your application will contact you if they need more information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Original documents</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don’t submit an original document unless you are asked to submit one.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Email addresses</h3>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> To protect your privacy, <strong>we will not use an email address if we can’t clearly read it</strong>. IRCC encourages all applicants to type out email addresses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure all email addresses on the forms are correct. Errors will cause delays.</li>
